 Final Report: Netflix Data Analysis Project
  By:Neha Rana

 Objective

The main goal of this project was to analyze a sample Netflix dataset to understand the type, rating, duration, and regional distribution of content. The analysis aimed to identify
patterns in content production and consumption that can help Netflix (or any media platform) make data-driven decisions about what kind of content to prioritize.

Dataset Overview

Total Entries: 100
Columns 13 (e.g., type, title, director, cast, country, release\_year, rating, duration, etc.)
Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Flask

Key Insights

1. Content Type Distribution

Movies (56%) dominate over TV Shows (44%) , but TV Shows tend to have slightly higher average ratings.

2. Rating Distribution

The most common rating is TV-MA, followed by TV-14 and TV-PG, indicating a preference for mature and teenage content.

3. Release Year Trends

Most content was released around 2020–2021, with a sharp rise in new additions during this period—likely due to increased content demand during the pandemic.

 4.Missing Data

Significant missing values in `director`, `cast`, and `country` columns were handled by filling with `'Not Available'`.

 5. Top Countries by Content

The United States leads in content production, followed by Japan, India, and United Kingdom.

6. Content Duration

TV Shows are generally categorized by number of seasons, while movie durations range between 90–125 minutes.

7. Genre Variety

Most content spans across multiple genres including Documentaries, TV Dramas, Comedies, Kids' TV, and Action & Adventure.

Solutions and Applications

For Content Strategists: Focus more on TV Shows with TV-MA or TV-14 ratings, as they are well-received and form the bulk of popular content.
For Regional Strategy: Invest in more content from India and Japan to diversify viewership.
  For Data Engineers: Implement better metadata quality checks to reduce missing values in critical fields like director and cast.
  For Product Teams: Use insights like genre preference and rating trends to enhance user recommendation algorithms.

Bonus Feature: API Integration

A simple Flask-based API was built to:

* Fetch all movies
* Get a movie by ID
* Filter movies by content type

This allows integration with web apps or dashboards for real-time querying.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of data analysis in shaping content decisions for streaming platforms. With enhanced data quality, real-time APIs, and detailed viewer insights, 
businesses like Netflix can better align their offerings with audience preferences.
